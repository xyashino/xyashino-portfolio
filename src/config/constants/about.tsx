export const EDUCATION_DESCRIPTION = `I began my programming journey during the pandemic at the age of 20. After initially diving into tutorials, I took a significant break. However, I've since rebounded and transitioned to developing real projects, which are showcased on my GitHub. While I'm currently pursuing part-time studies in Computer Science, I have the capacity to work full-time. My passion lies in full-stack development, and I consistently dedicate my free time to personal growth and enhancing my skills.`;
