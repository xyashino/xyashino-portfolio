export const EDUCATION_DESCRIPTION = `Hello! I'm a 20-year-old IT student eager to start a full-time role in the industry. My GitHub and personal website display my programming projects, emphasizing my proficiency in TypeScript, a technology I prefer for its flexibility in both functional and OOP programming. This choice reflects my ability to easily adapt to different technologies. While I haven't yet had the chance to gain commercial experience, Iâ€™m actively acquiring skills on my own. My drive to learn and grow is immense. Give me the opportunity, and I will dedicate myself to becoming a more skilled programmer every day.`;
