# Parish Webpage: A Comprehensive Parish Management Solution

The **Parish Webpage** is a full-stack application designed to emulate a simple parish website. It provides users with the ability to edit specific sections like intentions and announcements, offering a user experience similar to platforms like "Wordpress".

## Repositories

The project is divided into three main repositories:

- [Frontend - Client](https://github.com/xyashino/parish-webpage-front)
- [Backend](https://github.com/xyashino/parish-webpage-backend)
- [Frontend - Admin Panel](https://github.com/xyashino/parish-webpage-admin-panel)

## Admin Panel Overview

The admin panel is a crucial component of the Parish Webpage project. It serves as the management interface for the parish website, allowing administrators to:

- Edit and add announcements.
- Modify and create intentions.
- Manage albums, including the ability to upload photos.

The admin panel incorporates a rich text editor, thanks to the implementation of draft-js. This ensures that content creation and editing are seamless and intuitive.

Note: This application requires a backend. If you wish to run it locally, ensure that the backend is running. Otherwise, you'll only see the login page. Remember to rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the VITE_API_URL variable to the running server's URL.
