# MegaK-Head-Hunter: Bridging the Gap Between Headhunters and Students

In today's digital age, the process of connecting employers with potential candidates has been refined to unprecedented levels. Enter the **MegaK-Head-Hunter** applicationâ€”a specialized platform designed for headhunters to discover student profiles, initiate dialogues, and ultimately identify the ideal candidate.

## Roles and Functionalities:
The application is thoughtfully structured, categorizing users into three primary roles:

1. **Admin**:
- Manage and add new users.
- Oversee student registration via CSV file imports.
- Handle headhunter registration through a dedicated form.

2. **Student**:
- Access and update personal information.
- Indicate their hired status, reflecting their current employment situation.

3. **HeadHunter**:
- Navigate a vast array of student profiles.
- Begin conversations with students.
- Recruit students directly via the platform.

Every user, regardless of their designated role, has the capability to change their password. In case of forgotten credentials, they can reset it and receive a password reset link through email.

## Technical Overview:
The application's frontend, located in the [FRONTEND REPOSITORY](https://github.com/xyashino/MegaK-Head-Hunter-Front), is equipped with features such as data pagination, filtering, name-based search, authorization, authentication, routing, backend integration, and real-time form validation.

Conversely, the backend, situated in the [BACKEND REPOSITORY](https://github.com/xyashino/MegaK-Head-Hunter-BACK), is developed using the NestJS framework. It utilizes TypeOrm for ORM paired with a MySQL database. The backend adeptly manages authorization, authentication, data serialization through DTOs, pagination, data filtering, and even email dispatch functionalities.
